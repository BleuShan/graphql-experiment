# Hackathon 2017

## About
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) [RethinkDb](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) toolkit.

This a rather unfinished Hackathon entry. The idea is to explore the viability of an api
query language, namely GraphQL, as a Data access layer for open data.

## What's done
- A better understanding of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)
- A whole of boilerplate for a web app framework
- GraphQL Schema definition loading and a basic GraphQL type â€“ Database table mapping

## To Do
- An UI layer
- A scalar type collection.
- Automatic GraphQL query bindings
- Subscription queries
- Authentification and authorization
- Deploy scheme
